# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

## Description
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 

## Projects' tasks
1. A tidy data set
2. A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
4. Analysis R Script
